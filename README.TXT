PROJECT TITLE: Travel Boston
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This is a system to create personalized itineraries for a
user by providing them the ability to choose from a list of "Top things to do 
in Boston". This streamlines the process of travelling by giving someone a schedule.
Often times, people are short on time; they do not have the time that it takes to plan 
their trip--either they are too busy in meetings, or they spend all their time planning
their visit instead of actually visiting. This project was seeking to make that process 
easier for those that stop in and what to visit Boston and do not know where to start.
VERSION or DATE: June 12, 2019
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the driver class and have fun!
AUTHORS: Taylor Burke
USER INSTRUCTIONS: This project is meant to only be run from the driver class. The 
driver class users helper classes to query to user in order to customize their
itinerary as well as look through the subway system and find the best path for them
to take to get around the city. The scope of this project is limited to boston, the premade
list of things for the user to choose from, and the subway system. This project is scaleable!
The bus system as well as other systems can be easily added in later, as well as more
top things to do in boston. These two things were done by hand and are found in text files
in the project file.
